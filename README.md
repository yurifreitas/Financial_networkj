# ðŸŒŒ EtherSym Finance

ðŸŒ± **EtherSym Finance** is the result of a long journey to translate **biological principles into computational behavior**.  
Over the years, I have been exploring **symbiotic interfaces** â€” systems capable of learning, self-regulating, and evolving, inspired by living processes such as **homeostasis, regeneration, and energetic balance**.

This project was born from the desire to bring **biology closer to artificial intelligence** â€” to build networks that do not merely execute tasks, but **live within their own parameters**, adapting according to energy, error, and experience.

Technically, **EtherSym Finance** employs **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** with an **extended Dueling DQN architecture**, combining symbolic and biological mechanisms into a self-stabilizing learning system.
